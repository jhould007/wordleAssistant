# wordleAssistant
 A simple Wordle assistant program in Java. The program will prompt the user to enter their last guess and the colors of each letter in that guess (green, yellow or gray), and it will generate all possible next guesses based on that information. This will repeat until the user types "quit" (when they have correctly guessed the word), or they reach the maximum number of guesses, at which point the program will stop. 

# How to Run
Simply clone the repository and open it in your favorite editor or IDE. Open a terminal, navigate to the root folder, compile Wordle.java with "javac Wordle.java", and run with "java Wordle". Enjoy!
