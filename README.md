# wordleAssistant
 A simple Wordle assistant program in Java. The program will prompt the user to enter their last guess and the colors of each letter in that guess (green, yellow or gray), and it will generate all possible next guesses based on that information. This will repeat until the user types "quit" (when they have correctly guessed the word), or they reach the maximum number of guesses, at which point the program will stop. 

# How to Run
You can run this program in two different ways: 

1) Download the files "Wordle.class" and "5letterwords.txt", put them in a folder, open a terminal there, and run with "java Wordle". 
2) Clone the repository and open it in your favorite editor or IDE. Open a terminal, navigate to the root folder, and run with "java Wordle". 

I had fun making this, and I hope you enjoy using it as much as I enjoyed creating it. :)
